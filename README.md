# Remote Controled/Autonomous Smart Car Kit for Arduino
This is a work in progress for an remote controlled or autonomous smart car base on the Adeept Remote Control Smart Car Kit for Arduino

## Description:
Remote controlled car based on the Adeept Smart Car Kit and AdeeptMotor.ino

The car allows to be operated in 4 modes:
Mode 1: Remote control mode with joysticks.
Mode 2: Remote control with tilt sensor.
Mode 3: Autonomic mode using the ultrasonic distance sensor(s).
Mode 4: Autonomic line following mode.

Features completed:
(x) Mode 1 implemented.
( ) Mode 2 implemented.
( ) Mode 3 implemented.
( ) Mode 4 implemented.

( ) All modes should take use of the ultrasonic distance sensor to prevent collision.
( ) PID correction of direction.
( ) Red break lights.
( ) Orange turn lights.
